![GraphQL is all about relations](./graphql-is-about-relations.webp)

## skip if you don't like intros
Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.

## let's talk about the course
Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course. Here's the link. It's free. I have embed the entire playlist below, you can watch it right here.

### rating 4/5
While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for beginners. 

**pace** is remarkably right, it's neither too fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing

**full screencast** of code, I like where I don't have to see someone's face too much and the instructor explains things on codepad. So, this was a huge +

**great example** for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn't do justice to the concepts of GQL.

### what you need to know to do this course?
To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* CSS & HTML
* MongoDB

If you don't know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can be better than this.

### what you get to learn from this course?
This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would need to make a graphQL app.

#### for the backend
* Mutations
* Queries
* Resolvers
* GraphiQL


#### on the frontend
* query/mutation fire 
* parameterized query
* composing multiple query
* refetching queries on mutation

## after the course
As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you have done the basics you can learn about:

* graphql subscriptions
* *@client* i.e. managing local state
* typescript support
* authentication/authorization in the app
* writing tests for graphql query/mutations
* paginated queries
* *most important:* using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current API being used in apollo's documentation and everywhere in code.


## where can I see the final product?
If you follow and complete the entire course, you make something like this: [my booklist app](http://bit.ly/tanay-graphl-tut-app)

However, the course doesn't cover how to host it online. I have hosted the entire frontend and backend server for free. If you like to know how to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and whenever I write it, you'll get it straight into your inbox.

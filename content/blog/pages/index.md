Hi! I am Tanay! I work at Microsoft.

There are multiple Internet properties that I have created and you can find something interesting if you give **a minute to read**.

I spend my time on the internet with the sole **purpose of helping students land better jobs**. If you're a student and you don't want to end up in service companies doing **support job** then you have landed in the right place.

## üèïÔ∏è learning through bootcamp

If you're somewhere between an absolute beginner to full-stack web developer you should check out my bootcamp [neogcamp](https://neog.camp). Yes, it's paid. But you **can't just pay your way in**, you have to complete 2 months worth of free tutorials and assignments. I take **limited students** into the bootcamp after an interview and then work with them the whole year to groom them into a start full stack web developer.

So, if you're on the fence, I would suggest you **start with the [free tutorials](https://neog.camp/guide)** and see if you like my teaching style and I'll see if you're really **made for programming**.

## üí∞ placements and jobs

Whether you come from my bootcamp, or you learn yourself. If you're a talented full-stack web developer I can help you land an amazing tech job. I believe that our hiring is broken and it should be **less about degree** and **data structures** and more about programming your projects.

Luckily, quite a few startups have listened to me and they're hiring students whom I refer. I am on a public goal of **placing 100+ students** in 2021. You could be one of them if you have 5 projects ready. Check out more details on roc8(pronounced rocket as we are launching your career)'s [main website](https://elevatelabs.tech)

## ü¶ú social media handles

Active everywhere on almost all platforms. You can find the links to all social media channels, and student-focused telegram page, and a Discord server at the **bottom of this page.**

Take **one piece of advice for free** if you're a student. Join the Discord community. We have **5000+ focused programmers** in one place and we are doing book reading clubs, coding clubs, meetups, and what not! It's a thriving community.

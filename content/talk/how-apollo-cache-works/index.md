I have been working a lot on GraphQL and Apollo for my new project. So much so that to do exactly what I needed I debugged the entire Apollo Cache codebase and understood what happens on the inside. It was a great learning experience!

This is when I thought that I should share this and the idea of this talk came in. If you're not too busy on Saturday, Feb 9, 2019 then come and we can have a chat on how this works and what is all the rage about this state management tool in React.

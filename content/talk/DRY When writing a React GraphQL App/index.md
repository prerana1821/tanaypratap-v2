Let's face it, writing React apps with GraphQL is verbose. Your team took up a massive application write using React + GraphQL. It has a team of 200+ developers working on the same codebase. You need tools! You need abstraction! You need patterns! You don't want the same code to be written multiple times everywhere. How do you do that? Here comes middlewares on the frontend, links from Apollo, Observables and ASTs to ease your headache and make sure that you increase your team's productivity by making everyone write less code. Whether you are a single developer in a small startup or a big team working on a massive project, you do want to have these tricks up your sleeve!

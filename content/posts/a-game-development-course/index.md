Someday, when I get time from my other commitments, I might wanna take this opportunity and learn Game Development. It's an interesting challenge and I am hearing all good things about this course from the community.

But, if you are in college and you have some time to spare, please go ahead and learn this. Create your game and push all code to GitHub, write few (more than 5) blogs on Lua, Game Dev and the course. Do this for your profile, and I promise that next time when you ping me with your blog and github link and ask me to refer for an internship, I will do that. These are the things I wish kids do these days and then ping for internship. Show me that you're investing time outside your college curriculum and I will invest in you.

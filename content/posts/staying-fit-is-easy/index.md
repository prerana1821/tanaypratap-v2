I'm sure many of you have taken a resolution to be fit this year. I haven't been to gym in last 4 years and I consider myself fit by usual standards. I was a complete nerd during school and didn't play any sports whatsoever. Hell! I called them 'games'.
 
I remember we started playing badminton 4 years back when I was in Cypress, since then, I have taken formal training for Badminton, Swimming and Tennis. Have learned and played Cricket and Squash from friends. And I can say that this is much easier to do than going to gym everyday. Remember when we're kids and we used to look forward to playing with friends in the evening. It used to be the highlight of the day. This is similar!

I guess the point I am trying to make is that if you are unable to find the motivation after a long grueling stressful day to go to gym, let's play! 

**P.S.** I'm not trying to start a debate on gym vs sports, just trying to help with what has worked for me for a better part of my professional life.

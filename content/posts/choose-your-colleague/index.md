An organisation is totally sold when someone other than HR/Hiring pings you for a job offer. Today morning someone pinged me saying that they're looking for a React developer and if I'm interested. After I politely said no, this person pinged again to see if I can refer someone. I referred few people I know. 

Here's the point, if an employee/engineer is reaching out to actively hire for a team this means they really enjoy working there and see you as a potential teammate. When I go to these React community events, I ask the speakers to interview for Microsoft with the same mindset. 

LinkedIn would be a much better place if instead of head hunters people working on the projects go ahead and ask others to join their team or organisation. Agreed?

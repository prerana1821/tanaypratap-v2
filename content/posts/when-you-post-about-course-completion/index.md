I see people share certificates when they complete a course on LinkedIn. That is great! Congratulations!

Here's an idea which would make your post much more useful and I think even more engaging.
* rate the course 
* give a brief review, like how you review the movie for your friends in 3-4 lines
* write that one key learning which sticks with you after the course, one thing which touched you, moved you!

Same thing can be done for the books you're reading, or the blog you just shared.

P.S. Most of the authors are on LinkedIn and have a public profile. You can tag them in the post and thank them as well!
